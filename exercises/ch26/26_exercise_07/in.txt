The system_clock is one of the standard timers, 
and system_clock::now() returns the point of time (a time_point) at
which it is called. Subtract two time_points (here, t2-t1) 
and you get a length of time (a duration). We can use auto to
save us from the details of the duration and time_point types, 
which are surprisingly complicated if your view of time is
simply what you see on a wristwatch. In fact, the standard 
libraryâ€™s timing facilities were originally designed for advanced
physics applications and are far more flexible 
and general than most users need.
