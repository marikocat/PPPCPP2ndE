13. Write a program to "clean up" a text file for use in a word query program; that is, replace punctuation with whitespace,
put words into lower case, replace don't with do not (etc.), and remove plurals (e.g., ships becomes ship). Don't be too
ambitious. For example, it is hard to determine plurals in general, so just remove an s if you find both ship and ships. Use
that program on a real-world text file with at least 5000 words (e.g., a research paper).
14. Write a program (using the output from the previous exercise) to answer questions such as: "How many occurrences of
ship are there in a file?" "Which word occurs most frequently?" "Which is the longest word in the file?" "Which is the
shortest?" "List all words starting with s." "List all four-letter words."
15. Provide a GUI for the program from the previous exercise. which
