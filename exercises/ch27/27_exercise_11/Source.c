// The list of C language features that are not adopted by C++ and are only present in C:

// Designated Initializers: C allows you to initialize specific members of a struct or an array using designated initializers, which let you assign values to specific positions or fields.

// Variable-Length Arrays (VLAs): C allows for arrays whose size is determined at runtime using a non-constant expression.

// Trailing Commas in Enum Declarations: In C, you can have a trailing comma after the last enumerator in an enum declaration.

// Compound Literals with auto: C allows you to use the auto keyword to create compound literals with inferred types.

// Use of register Keyword: In C, you can use the register keyword to suggest that a variable be stored in a CPU register for faster access.

// Empty Declarations: In C, you can have an empty declaration like ; as a statement.

// restrict Keyword: C introduced the restrict keyword to indicate that a pointer is the only way to access a particular object.

// Implicit Conversion of void* to Other Pointer Types: In C, void* can be implicitly converted to other pointer types without requiring a cast.

// _Generic Keyword: C11 introduced the _Generic keyword, which allows for type-generic programming.

// Inline Functions with External Linkage: In C, an inline function with external linkage (defined in one translation unit) can be used in multiple source files.

// Implicit int Declarations: In C, if a function is used without a prior declaration, it is implicitly assumed to return an int.

// Implicit int Promotion: C performs implicit integer promotions for certain operations involving smaller integral types.

// Wide Character and String Handling Functions (wchar_t, wprintf, etc.): C introduced wide character and string handling functions for internationalization purposes.

// These features highlight the unique aspects of the C programming language that are not adopted by C++.
