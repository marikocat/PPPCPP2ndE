/*C++ was developed as an extension of the C programming language, adding object-oriented programming features, among others. Many of the features introduced in C++ were later adopted back into the C language or influenced its development. Here's a list of some C language features that were inspired by or borrowed from C++ (C with Classes):

Standard I/O Library (<stdio.h>): While not directly from C++, C's standard I/O library was inspired by C++'s I/O streams, providing functions like printf() and scanf().

Header Files (<header.h>): C++'s header files concept, used for organizing declarations and definitions, influenced C's inclusion of header files.

Comments (// and / * * /): C++-style single-line (//) and multi-line (/ * * /) comments were adopted by C.

Compound Literals: C introduced compound literals, which were inspired by C++'s constructors. They allow you to create unnamed objects with a specific value.

Structures and Unions: C's structs and unions were influenced by C++ classes, making complex data structures more manageable.

Enumeration Types: C++'s enum concept, used to create named integral constants, was adopted by C.

const Qualifier: C adopted the const qualifier from C++ to define constants and indicate immutability.

Function Prototypes: The C language started using function prototypes (function declarations) for better type checking, similar to C++'s member function declarations.

void Pointers: The concept of void pointers was influenced by C++ to provide a generic pointer type.

Standard Math Library (<math.h>): The math library in C was inspired by C++'s <cmath>.

Preprocessor Enhancements: Some preprocessor enhancements in C were influenced by C++'s preprocessing features, like macro stringification (# operator).

Dynamic Memory Allocation (<stdlib.h>): Memory management functions like malloc() and free() were influenced by C++ memory management concepts.

Standard Library (<stdlib.h> and <string.h>): Various functions in C's standard library were influenced by similar concepts in C++, like string handling and memory functions.

Type Qualifiers (const and volatile): Type qualifiers for variables and pointers (const and volatile) were inspired by C++'s use of qualifiers for member functions and member variables.

Function Pointer Syntax: C adopted C++-like function pointer syntax for declaring and using function pointers.

size_t Type: The size_t type, commonly used for array sizes and memory allocations, was influenced by C++.

Boolean Type: C introduced the _Bool type and stdbool.h header, influenced by C++'s bool type.

Variadic Macros: The concept of variadic macros was influenced by C++'s variadic templates.

It's important to note that while C borrowed certain features from C++ over the years, both languages maintain their unique design philosophies and purposes. While C evolved with influences from C++, it remained a distinct language with its own strengths and areas of application.*/
